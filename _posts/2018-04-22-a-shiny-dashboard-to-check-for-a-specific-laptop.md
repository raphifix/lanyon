I have recently become interested in moving on from my current laptop to a Macbook Pro. My preference is for a 13" from 2015, which for various reasons is arguably better than the more recent models. Further, I would like to purchase straight from Apple to get the full warranty (and potentially purchase AppleCare). Instead of going to Apple's refurbished page directly, I built a Shiny dashboard that uses the `rvest` package to scrape the page, process the models, and highlight potentially relevant ones.
