To delete multiple lines in Vim, first enter command mode by pressing `Esc`.

Then put the cursor on the line you want to delete. If you want to delete multiple lines at once, navigate to the first line of the block you want to delete.

Then, type `dd` to delete one line, or type the number of lines you want to delete followed by `dd`. So if you want to delete 3 lines including the one your cursor's on, type `3dd`.
