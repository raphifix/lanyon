It is straight-forward to access to last element of a list in Python.

```python
test_list = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4']
```

To access `'item4'`, use `test_list[-1]`.

This extends to the nth element as well. So to access the 2nd to last element of `test_list`, use `test_list[-2]`, 3rd to last: `test_list[-3]`, etc.
